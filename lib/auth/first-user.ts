 * Deliberately "is there anybody", not "is there someone called
 * ADMIN_USERNAME": renaming the account in Settings must not cause the next
 * start to quietly create a second one. The two used to be separate rules in
 * separate scripts, and the seed script's checked the name — so a rename
 * followed by `npm run db:seed` made a second account. Both the image's
 * migrate step and the seed script now call this.
 *
 * Takes its own connection rather than the app's pool, because both callers run
 * outside Next and close the connection when they are done.
