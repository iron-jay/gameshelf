/**
 * What a failed request looks like instead of a bare 500.
 *
 * It sits at the root so it also catches the app layout, which is where the
 * session lookup runs — the first query of every request, and so the first
 * thing to fail when the database is unreachable.
 *
 * Next strips a server error's message before it reaches the browser, which is
 * right and means this component cannot read the Postgres code. So it asks
 * instead: /health is a query and nothing else, and its answer separates "the
 * database is down" from "something in gameshelf is broken" — two problems with
 * nothing in common except the status code.
